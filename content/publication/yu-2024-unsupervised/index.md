abstract: Bone marrow edema-like lesions (BMEL) in the knee have been linked to the symptoms and progression of osteoarthritis (OA), a highly prevalent disease with profound public health implications. Manual and semi-automatic segmentations of BMELs in magnetic resonance images (MRI) have been used to quantify the significance of BMELs. However, their utilization is hampered by the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of the process as well as by annotator bias, especially since BMELs exhibit various sizes and irregular shapes with diffuse signal that lead to poor intra- and inter-rater reliability. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised method for fully automated segmentation of BMELs that leverages conditional diffusion models, multiple MRI sequences that have different contrast of BMELs, and anomaly detection that do not rely on costly and error-prone annotations. We also analyze BMEL segmentation annotations from multiple experts, reporting intra-/inter-rater variability and setting better benchmarks for BMEL segmentation performance.
