I also attended middle and high school in the Cleveland suburbs.</p> <p> Music is my main hobby. My main instrument is acoustic steel guitar, but I also enjoy playing keyboard and singing. I also like to write my own music, especially composition and arrangement. I have a special interest in applying AI/ML to music, specifically sound modeling, low-latency networks, and music theory.</p> <p>\ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 My Korean name is \uc720\uc11c\ud658 (\uc720=Yu, \uc11c=Seo, \ud658=Hwan).
